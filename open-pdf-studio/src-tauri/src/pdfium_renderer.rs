//! PDFium rendering integration for Open PDF Studio.
//!
//! Wraps the `pdfium-render` crate with the bindings we need for
//! `render_pdf_page` and `render_thumbnail` Tauri commands. Owns a
//! single static `Pdfium` instance for the lifetime of the app.
//!
//! Thread-safety: the `thread_safe` feature of `pdfium-render` wraps every
//! call in an internal mutex, so multiple Tauri command threads can
//! invoke PDFium concurrently — they just serialise inside PDFium.
